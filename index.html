        Hello! This website serves as a place for me to store and showcase some of my various projects.
        I intend to include examples from my academic work (machine learning, language processing),
        my professional projects (environmental health, risk assessment), and also my hobby interests (game theory).
        Feel free to browse around and see what Iâ€™ve been up to!
      </p>
